            <p className='mb-3'> React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL. Let us create a simple application to React to understand how the React Router works. The application will contain three components: home component, about a component, and contact component. We will use React Router to navigate between these components. </p>
